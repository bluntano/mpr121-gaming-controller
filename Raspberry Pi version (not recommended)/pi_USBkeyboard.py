# Adafruit Raspberry Pi MPR121 Keyboard Example
# Author: Tony DiCola, Brennen Bearnes
#
# Allows you to turn touches detected by the MPR121 into key presses on a
# Raspberry Pi.
#
# Dependencies
# ============
#
# Make sure you have the required dependencies by executing the following commands:
#
#   sudo apt-get update
#   sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-pip libudev-dev
#   sudo pip3 install python-uinput
#   sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-mpr121
#
# Usage
# =====
#
# To use this program you first need to connect the MPR121 board to the Raspberry
# Pi (either connect the HAT directly to the Pi, or wire the I2C pins SCL, SDA to
# the Pi SCL, SDA, VIN to Pi 3.3V, GND to Pi GND).
#
# Next define the mapping of capacitive touch input presses to keyboard
# button presses.  Scroll down to the KEY_MAPPING dictionary definition below
# and adjust the configuration as described in its comments.
#
# Finally run the script as root:
#
#   sudo python3 pi_keyboard.py
#
# Try pressing buttons and you should see key presses made on the Pi!  (Note
# that you need to be logged directly into the Pi to see the keypresses -
# over an SSH or console cable connection, you won't see anything.)
#
# Press Ctrl-C to quit at any time.
